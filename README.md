# tkinter-examples-test-1
This repository contains Python files with examples using the Tkinter library. 
The project is still a work in progress and not yet fully complete.

This is a test project as you understand from the name.It doesn't mean anything in its current state. Even for me.

Maybe it would growth and would be a good scale tutorial repository when it went some step.
