--- CONGRATULATIONS ---  d(>_â€¢ )

If you've reached this point, congratulations, praise youself because you deserve this

You've been learned:

*Creating a top level window, 
*Adjusting size, position, backgraound and title of that window

*And also assigning iconphoto along this lesson


Right now, for the next lesson or tutorial file,
you will learn binding keys in a couple of file
and you will change the iconphotos via those keys

Go tk.t folder from main folder, and don't skip to INTRO.md file.
